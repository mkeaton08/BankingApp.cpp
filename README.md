# Bank-Program

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving
I created a banking program that will teach students the concepts of fiscal responsibility (such as living within their means and spending less than they make) via an interactive system. The main focus on this program is investing and the power of compound interest. This program allows a user to input a monthly deposit amount and input the amount of interest over a period of time and will compute the results.

# What did you do particularly well?
What I did very well in this project is create variables and methods that have clear and descriptive names such as initialAmount, monthlyDeposit, and calcInterest. This enhances readability and makes the code more self-explanatory for others. When code is easy to understand, it is easier to modify and update improving the overall maintability of the code.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
An area I could enhance my code is to implement user imput validation. This would ensure the user inputs a valid number to calculate monthly interest. For example, current code allows a user to enter a negative number to deopsit where implementing input validation would inform the user to input positive numbers only.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The piece of the code that I found to be the most challenging to write was the nested for loop to calculate interest. The outer for loop interates through each year where the inner loop iterates through each month in the year. A resource that helped me complete this part of the code was using Stack Overflow. I was able to find some helpful tips and ideas that allowed me to create the most crucial part of the program and calculate interest.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
A skill that was picked up while working on this project was to create classes within C plusplus. Classes allow me to bundle data members and functions into a single unit. By using access specifiers like public and private, I can control the visibility of class members. This means I can hide the state of an object to provide a clear and controlled interface for interacting with the object, which also promotes data integrity and security.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
What I did in this project to make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable is add in-line comments that adhere to industry best standards. The comments are easy to read and allow others to understand what the line of code does and why I added it into the program. This helps maintain the overall readbility of my code.
